# K-Cafe Ordering System

Welcome to the K-Cafe Ordering System! This project aims to provide a seamless online ordering experience for customers and an admin dashboard for managing orders. The system is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on clean and intuitive user interfaces.

## Features

- **Client End**: The client end allows customers to place their orders by providing their name and order information. They will receive an alert when their order is ready for pickup.
- **Admin Panel**: The admin panel provides a comprehensive overview of all incoming orders. Admins can easily manage the orders and send alerts to customers when their orders are ready.
- **Lock Control**: The admin panel also features lock control, allowing admins to lock or unlock the pickup location. Customers can unlock the lock using a designated code to retrieve their food.
- **Status Control**: The status control feature enables admins to send alerts to customers when their orders are ready to be picked up. Customers will receive a notification to collect their food.
